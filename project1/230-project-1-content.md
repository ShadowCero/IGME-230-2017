This is an abstract game, your avatar *(a square)* is avoiding the circles coming at it and trying to destroy it.

___
## V. Aesthetics
The graphics for this game will be abstract, with a single cube (possibly changing colors over time) as the player character, there will be multiple different colored circles of different sizes and a solid green triangle. The backround will either be a solid white or white with a simple pattern over it, not too intrusive.

The sound will be a high energy techno song to reflect the fast and hectic pace of the game. Also will try to get a slower paced version of the song for use while the slowdown mechanic is used.

## VI. Gameplay
### **Mechanics**
The main mechanic of the game is avoidance, the player avoids being hit by the cirlces and lives. The longer they live the higher score they get, similar to time trials. Slowdown mechanic obtained by picking up power-ups, will slow down the circles making them easier to dodge and provide a score boost.
### **Control**
Keyboard Controls:

WASD or arrow keys for movement (8 directional)

Shift or Space for slowdown.
### **Teaching the game**
There will be an instructional screen the players can access from the menu of the game. It will tell the players controls, the goal of avoiding the circles, and the triangle power ups and about the score bonus is gives. 
### **Player Learning**
The player only needs to survive in order to get a good score but there will be strategies in order to maximize scores. The slowdown power up will provide a score bonus at an exponential rate for as long as the slowdown has been going on for. Players can let a bunch of the power ups gather on screen then collect them in order to maximize the slowdown time and get the largest score bonus.
