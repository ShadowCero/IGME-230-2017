                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating a "simple" evasion game while sounds simple was quite the task for me at the start.</li>
                        <li>There is a ton of set up to the scene which I never considered when starting this which turned this project into an arduous task.</li>
                        <li>For this project I used the circle blast exercise as a base since it had similar logic to what my game would need.</li>
                        <li>I then built the game's logic from there using a ton of tutorials.</li>
                        <li>W3Schools and the PIXIJS tutorials provided me with the most information such as time and keyboard controls.</li>
                        <li>One problem I encountered when making the game was my time slowing feature.</li>
                        <li>I wasn't able to figure out how to keep track of time while holding the key with the way I read keyboard inputs.</li>
                        <li>Because of this I nyxed the powerups and the time limit on the power. I kept the power in the game though since the two different speeds are exhilirating.</li>
                        <li>Another bug is that some circles wont bounce off the edges of the screen and get stuck there.</li>
